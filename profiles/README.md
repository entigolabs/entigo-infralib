## Profiles ##
Contains base profiles used by [entigo-infralib-agent](https://github.com/entigolabs/entigo-infralib-agent) that we use on many clients. It is a way of simplifying common setups by assembling different modules with in a certain way.

Profiles do not contain any client specific data but provide good defaults for certain types of installations.

The agent configuration parameter base_config.profile must be a name of a file in this folder without the .conf.
